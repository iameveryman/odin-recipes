# odin-recipes
This is one of the first projects I'm attempting while working through the lessons on The Odin Project website.

This will be an example project to create a website of recipes.  

This is something my wife may find useful in the future so I'll be using this as a template going forward in my wider web development and software developing goals of creating a home server with a family website that we can access from anywhere.
